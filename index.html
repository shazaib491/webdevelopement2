    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    Son Goku[nb 1] is a fictional character and the star of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.
    Serving as the main protagonist of the series, he is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey
    King in the West), a main character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West (16th century), combined
    with influences from the Hong Kong martial arts films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku first made his debut in
    the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku,[nb 2][nb 3] originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen
    Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.[2] Born Kakarot,[nb 4][nb 5] Goku is introduced as an eccentric,
    monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on
    a journey to find the magical seven Dragon Balls that can grant the user one wish. Along the way, he finds new
    friends who follow him on his journey to become a stronger fighter. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's
    mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also
    gaining new allies in the process.

    As the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of
    the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super), as
    well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of
    the most recognizable and iconic characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo
    appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has
    appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the
    Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17–42, as opposed to his initial child
    form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.[3] Goku's critical reception has been largely
    positive and he is often considered to be one of the greatest manga and anime characters of all time.

    <h1>About us</h1>
    Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon
    Boy. In this story, the protagonist looks a lot like Goku, but has a pair of wings.[4] The original inspiration
    was Hong Kong martial arts films, including Bruce Lee films such as Enter the Dragon (1973) and Jackie Chan
    films such as Drunken Master (1978);[5][6] Toriyama said he had a young Jackie Chan in mind for a live-action
    Goku, stating that "nobody could play Goku but him."[7]

    The character Goku is based on Sun Wukong (Son Goku in Japanese),[nb 6] the central character of the Chinese
    novel Journey to the West.[8] To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy
    with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing
    feature.[9] He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on.[10]
    Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other
    planets that he established him as a Saiyan[nb 7][nb 8].[11] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any
    planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.[12]

    Wanting the series to have a Chinese appearance, Toriyama used the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks for
    Goku's dōgi.[13] During the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that
    Goku looked rather plain. Toriyama had given him simple clothes on purpose because it was a fighting manga, so
    to combat this he added several characters like Master Roshi and Krillin, and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai[nb
    9][nb 10] to focus the storyline on fighting. To defy the assumption that Goku would win the tournaments,
    Toriyama made him lose the first and second but win the third.[9] Toriyama also mentioned Torishima wanted Goku
    to form a relationship with BulmGoku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier

    Bulma, but this was never applied to the series.[14]

    Toriyama's editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist
    drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the
    series if the character did not.[15] Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight
    scenes easier.[16]a, but this was never applied to the series.[14]
